00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.000
Money that which separates the haves from the have nots.

1
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.000
Patience, frugality. 

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Sacrifice.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Deciding to invest in your family's future.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And taking responsibility for the consequences of those actions.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Mr. Byrde.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hello.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Trevor Evans, FBI.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Whats going on?

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.000
We believe your husband is partnered with murder.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let’s all stop playing this game, shall we? 
The lying the running aren’t you both tired?

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We made a choice to move our family to a more peaceful place.

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.000
Mom what are we doing here?

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Your father is laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Marty where’s my 5 million dollars?

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Someone is going to die.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Relax.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Why do I have this feeling we both know that you’d be better off dead.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Marty.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We're gonna kill your family and we’ll be done with all this madness.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.000
Jesus, Marty he knows the kids’ names.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Last chance for witness protection.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is just another betrayal isn’t it? How long have you been planning this?

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.000
You have walled me out.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
The money is at its essences that measure of a man’s choices

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What’d you do today for our family?
