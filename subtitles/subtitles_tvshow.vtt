00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Money.

1
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
To be ruled.

2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the end.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Itâ€™ll be ever man for himself.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Gentlemen.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What are you prepared to do?

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
No offence, but I don't play well with others.
