00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
To be ruled.

In the end.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Itâ€™ll be ever man for himself.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
No offence, but I don't play well with others.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Big man in a suit armor, take that away, what are you?

16

Ahh genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

17
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If we can't protect the earth.

17
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.900

Doctor Banner, your work is is unparalleled and I'm a huge fan in 
the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
